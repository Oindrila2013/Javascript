As endangered apex predators, their populations have significantly declined due to human activity, but conservation efforts in some regions, like India, have shown promise for their recovery. Key facts include their diet of large mammals, solitary nature, excellent hunting skills aided by soft paw pads."

Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones."
